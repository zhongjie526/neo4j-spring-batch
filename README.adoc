== Neo4j Interview Exercise

=== Instructions

Set up Neo4j (Docker / VM). 

```
docker run --publish=7474:7474 --publish=7687:7687 --volume=$HOME/neo4j/data:/data -e dbms.memory.heap.initial_size=1024m -e dbms.memory.heap.max_size=2048m  neo4j
```

== Compile and package




To manually initialize the project:

. Navigate to https://start.spring.io.
This service pulls in all the dependencies you need for an application and does most of the setup for you.
. Choose either Gradle or Maven and the language you want to use. This guide assumes that you chose Java.
. Click *Dependencies* and select *Spring Data Neo4j*.
. Click *Generate*.
. Download the resulting ZIP file, which is an archive of a web application that is configured with your choices.

NOTE: If your IDE has the Spring Initializr integration, you can complete this process from your IDE.
